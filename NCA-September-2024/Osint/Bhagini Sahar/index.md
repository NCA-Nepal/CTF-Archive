I have a friend from Nepal who says his city and his auntâ€™s foreign city are sister cities. He sent me a photo and challenged me to find the names of both cities and the mayor of his own city. Crack the code!

Flag format: `nca{aunt's city_friend's city_firstname_lastname}`

**Note**: lowercase only, and submit just the first word of each city.
